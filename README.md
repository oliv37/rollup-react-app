# Rollup React App 

## Goal

Configuring a React App from scratch using Rollup is not an easy task.

Rollup is mostly used to build libraries, but it can also be used to build applications.

This sample project build an App using the following tools :

* Npm
* Rollup
* Typescript
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Jest
* React Testing Library

## Install

`npm install`

## Run

`npm start`

It should build and open the App at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The App is started in watch mode, so you can update a source file and see the change in the browser. 

## Build

`npm run build`

The result bundles `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` are minified.

## Test

`npm test`

The tests are started using Jest in watch mode.

## Build the App from scratch

1. Install React

`npm i react react-dom`

2. Install Rollup

`npm i rollup -D`
